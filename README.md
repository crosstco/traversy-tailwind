# Tailwind Crash Course

This repository is a follow-along of @bradtraversy's Tailwind Crash Course (https://youtu.be/dFgzHOX84xQ?si=LmwSpi4tkUefaD_X)

This was done to get familiar with the concepts of Tailwind before building my personal portfolio using Next.js and Tailwind. It is worth noting that this is just a stylized landing page to get a feel for Tailwind - the buttons/nav locations do not go anywhere.
